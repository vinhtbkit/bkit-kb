## Overview
This recipe describe how you can use `spring-boot-docker-compose` library from Spring Boot 3.1 to quickly integrate with `docker-compose`
- Prior to Spring Boot 3.1, you'll need to use the `docker-compose` command separately
- From Spring Boot 3.1 onwards, you have a choice of having Spring Boot managing your `docker-compose.yml`

## Setup and run
- Pre-requisites:
  - `docker` should be installed and docker daemon should be running
